# Headings
To create headings we use hash symbols (#)
We can also create different "level" headings
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes

## This is a subheading level 2

### This is a subheading level 3

level 6 is the smallest

# Modifying Text Styles

## bold and italics
We can use asterisks (\**) to modify text style, specifically bold and italics
i want this **word** to be bold
I was this *word* to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized
***this whole sentences in emphasized***

## Aside:Escape Characters
If we want to place a character that is ALREADY a keyword or **reserved character** we use the back slash (\\) 


## Strikethrough 
we can strike through characters or words using the tilde(~)

e.g.
Mr. Ubial knows how to spell ~~neighbor~~ neighbour
~~This whole Sentence is a mistake~~

# Blockquotes
Block quotes allows us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text 
We use carets (>) to create bloackquotes

e.g.

>This is an example of blockquote
>This is line two of blockquote
>
>This is line four of the blockquote; the third line is blank

# Lists
Create both *unordered* and *ordered* lists

## Unordered Lists
To create each point we use asterisks (\*) with a space behind it
We can create a sub portion of the list by placing TABS before the asterisk

e.g.
* Dairy
	* eggs
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice

## Ordered Lists
If there is a specific order to the elements in our lists, we can create an ordered list
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists.

e.g.

1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter(Hold shit to create a second line)
   Both brown and granulated should be added
3. Using the mixer, cream sugar and butter together

# Tables
We can organize information in tables using Markdown
We use dashes (-) and pipe (|).

Tables in Markdown require Headings

e.g.

| Name    | Age   | Sign    |   Superpower    |
|---      | ---   | ---     |   ---           |
|Bruce Wayne | 35 | Aquarius|
|Ricco Chong | 14 | IDK |
