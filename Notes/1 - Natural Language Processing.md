# Output
we can display texts and symbols using output

We use the `print`() function to display output

```python
print()
```

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are ***NOT*** interpreted by python
This means that the text is ***ignored***
We use the # ***symbol*** to make comments


# [[Headers]]

# input
we grab information from the user using `input`()
it will wait for the user to tupe something in and press ENTER/RETURN
```python
input()
input(<rompt<)
```
