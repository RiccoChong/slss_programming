**Modules** are pieces of code that we can borrow in Python
This includes things like **functions** 

>For example, in random we use the .choice() function
>to choose something randomly from a [[lists]]

These pieces of code are *not* automatically included,
so we need to `import` them into our code explicitly


# `import`
The `import` keyword loads the module into our Python file
**`imports` should be at the top of our file, under the header**

# `The time module`
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time
Specifically, we can use `time` to pause our code


```python
import time

# Pause our code for 1 second
time.sleep(1)
```
