# Output
we can display texts and symbols using output

We use the `print`() function to display output

```python
print()
```

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are ***NOT*** interpreted by python
This means that the text is ***ignored***
We use the # ***symbol*** to make comments


# [[Headers]]

# input
we grab information from the user using `input`()
it will wait for the user to tupe something in and press ENTER/RETURN
```python
input()
input(<prompt<)
```


# Variables
Variables allow us to **store** information for the time our app us running.
(store the input into the variable "favourite food")


```python
favourite_food = input("What is your favourite food? ")
```

favourite_food -> ***name*** of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value

# [[Strings]]

# [[Design]]

# [[lists]]
# [[Modules]]

# [[Conditionals]]
