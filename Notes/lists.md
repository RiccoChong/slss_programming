In Python, lists are a collection of items.
We store values inside of lists.
The values of the items can be of different [[Types]]
***Order*** matters in a list

# creating a list
To make a list, we use brackets \[] To surround our list
We separate the in individual items wit commas \""

```python
some_list = ["Jimmy", "sara", "Fredreiqe"]
```

# access Elements in the List
We can access the individual things from lists using **bracket notation**
In the example below, we'll use bracket notation to access "Sara"

```python
some_list[1]     # "Sara"
some_list[0]     # "Jimmy"
some_list[2]     # "Frederique"
some_list[-1].   # "Fredrique" counts from the end
some_list[-2].   # "Sara"
```

Inside the brackets, we give the *index* of the item we want.
Python uses **0-index** counting, which means we start counting at 0.
