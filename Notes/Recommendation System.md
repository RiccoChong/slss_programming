# Recommendation Systems

## Popularity and "Likes"

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on 
how many people "like" the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in 
Instagram. When you click on that heart button, Instagram
records it somewhere along with other data like demographic
and psychographic information. With this information,
they might suggest to other users similar to you, products
and services that you like.

We implemented the Popularity/Likes paradigm with our
Favourite Bubble Tea activity.

## N-Point Rating System

N-point rating systems are used by many services
particularly Jeff Bezos' baby, Amazon.

This paradigm provides more granular information.
Buyers are asked to rate the product on a 5-point
scale. All the ratings are put together and an
aggregate score is given out of five stars
